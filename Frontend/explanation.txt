# Project Structure and Code Explanation

## 1. Project Structure Overview

The project is a React-based frontend application for "The Best Group of Colleges". It uses **Vite** as a build tool, **React Router** for navigation, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The architecture is modular, separating pages, components, layouts, and state management (context).

### Root Directory
- **`src/`**: Contains all the source code for the application.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets like images and icons that are served directly.
- **`index.html`**: The entry point HTML file.
- **`package.json`**: Manages dependencies and scripts.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Configuration for the Vite build tool.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.

### Source Directory (`src/`) Breakdown

#### `src/main.jsx`
- **Role**: The entry point of the React application.
- **Dependencies**: Imports `React`, `ReactDOM`, `App.jsx` and global styles.
- **Function**: It mounts the `App` component into the DOM root element defined in `index.html`.

#### `src/App.jsx`
- **Role**: The main application component that handles routing.
- **Dependencies**: React Router (`Routes`, `Route`), Layouts, Pages, Context Providers.
- **Function**: Defines the navigation structure of the app, including public routes, campus-specific routes, and secure portal routes (Admin, Faculty, Student). It wraps different sections of the app with their respective Context Providers (`AdminProvider`, `FacultyProvider`, `StudentProvider`).

#### `src/layouts/`
Contains wrapper components that define the common structure (header, sidebar, footer) for different sections of the app.
- **`RootLayout.jsx`**: Layout for the public website (Navbar + Outlet + Footer).
- **`CampusLayout.jsx`**: Layout for campus pages, likely adding campus-specific navigation.
- **`AdminLayout.jsx`**: Layout for the Admin Portal (Sidebar + Header + Dashboard Content).
- **`FacultyLayout.jsx`**: Layout for the Faculty Portal.
- **`StudentLayout.jsx`**: Layout for the Student Portal.

#### `src/context/`
Uses React Context API to manage global state across the application without prop drilling.
- **`AdminContext.jsx`**: Manages state for the Admin portal (current user, selected campus, lists of campuses/users).
- **`FacultyContext.jsx`**: Manages state for Faculty (current user, assigned classes, assignments stats).
- **`StudentContext.jsx`**: Manages state for Students (current user, enrolled courses, results, attendance).

#### `src/pages/`
Contains the detailed functional components representing each page view.
- **`Home.jsx`, `About.jsx`, `Admissions.jsx`...**: specific pages for the public website.
- **`campuses/`**: Contains pages for specific campuses (Main, Law, Hala) and common sub-pages (`AcademicsPage`, `StudentLifePage`).
- **`admin/`**: Pages for the Admin Dashboard (User management, Course management, Campus management).
- **`faculty/`**: Pages for the Faculty Dashboard (Assignments, Results, Materials).
- **`student/`**: Pages for the Student Dashboard (My Courses, Results, Announcements).

#### `src/components/`
Reusable UI components used across pages.
- **`ui/`**: Generic UI elements like `Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, `Hero` sections.
- **`admin/`, `faculty/`, `student/`**: Specific components used only within their respective portals (e.g., specific charts, tables, or cards).

## 2. Key Dependencies and Data Flow

1.  **Routing (App.jsx)**: The app uses `react-router-dom`. The `App` component is the central hub where all pages are imported and assigned to routes.
2.  **State Management (Context)**: The `App.jsx` wraps portal routes with their specific providers.
    -   *Example*: All routes under `/admin/*` are wrapped in `<AdminProvider>`. This means any component inside the admin section can access admin data via `useAdminContext()`.
3.  **Layouts**: Pages don't usually include the Navbar or Footer directly. Instead, they are rendered inside a Layout component via the `<Outlet />` mechanism of React Router.

## 3. Directory & File Roles Summary

| Directory | File | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src` | `main.jsx` | App Entry Point. Mounts the React app. |
| `src` | `App.jsx` | Main Router and Provider wrapper. |
| `src/layouts` | `*Layout.jsx` | Structural wrappers (Navbar/Sidebar) for different app sections. |
| `src/context` | `*Context.jsx` | Stores and exposes global state (User data, lists) to components. |
| `src/pages` | `*.jsx` | The main views (screens) user sees. |
| `src/components/ui`| `*.jsx` | Reusable small UI blocks (Buttons, Inputs). |

## 4. File Interactions

*   **App.jsx** imports **Pages** (e.g., `Home`, `Dashboard`) and **Contexts** (`AdminProvider`).
*   **Pages** import **Components** (e.g., `Hero`, `Table`) and use **Context Hooks** (e.g., `useAdminContext`) to fetch data.
*   **Contexts** verify logic and provide data/functions to **Pages** and **Components**.
